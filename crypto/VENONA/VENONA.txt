You've been deployed on a classified reconnaissance mission deep in the jungles of Vietnam. After days of trekking through dense foliage, your team discovers an abandoned intelligence outpost that appears to have been hastily evacuated.
As the team's cryptanalyst, you're tasked with investigating a small underground room containing what looks like a communication center. Among scattered papers and broken equipment, you find:

A peculiar reference table (see attached image) with alphabetic grid patterns
Scattered papers with two plaintext messages and three encrypted messages.

Intelligence believes one of the three messages contains critical information about enemy operations.
