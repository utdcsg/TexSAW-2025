# Deleted Evidence

## Category
Forensics - Medium-Hard

## Description
Someone used this computer to generate the flag, but it has since been deleted. We werenâ€™t able to image the computer, but we did acquire this memory dump and this executable.  
(Note: Find the last flag generated, from the last seed created, and append the timestamp for the creation of the last seed in YYYY-MM-DD_Hr:Min:Sec.  
Ex. texsaw{0fffabcd01234567_2025-04-01_08:00:00})  

Memory File: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12R4lO-t0PdEsH7zFL8X6HVeNjehrbMAg/view?usp=sharing  

## Solution
The user is expected to use Volatility 2 for memory analysis. There are a suspicious number of Notepad.exe processes running. The user can find out that generator.exe was run recently through cmdline/userassist, and is expected to look at MFT timestamps to find that the last created seed file was seed_89.txt. The user can dump the memory of the latest Notepad.exe instance (corresponding with this seed) and find the seed as a string. Then, the user creates a .txt file with this seed, inputs it to generator.exe, and receives the flag.

## Flag
texsaw{0f59ede3e09e5a4d18b480be9e56f3c2aa1ed0b67287f0bc60ca0b2bce62ac28_2025-03-26_02:08:23}

## Downloadable

generator.tar

## Building Binaries
Shouldn't need to build any binaries (generator.exe) because challenge is self-contained in memory dump and executable. Running the executable requires having Visual Studio 2022 and Visual C++ Redistributable installed.  

Building generator requires Visual Studio 2022, CMake, and the OpenSSL library.  
- Download Visual C++ Redistributable  
- Download Visual Studio 2022  
- Install OpenSSL using a supported package manager on Windows (I used Chocolatey https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openssl)  
- Place CMakeLists and generator.cpp in the same directory (/generator)  
- Create a "Build" directory and cd into it (/generator/Build)  
- Run "cmake .."  
- Run "cmake --build ."  
- The "generator.exe" executable should be in (/generator/Build/Debug)
