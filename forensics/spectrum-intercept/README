CTF Instructions (do not give to participants):
This challenge features 7 images, each themed around concepts like lost signals, frequencies, waveforms, and old communication devices.

Hidden within each image is a Caesar ciphered clue embedded in the EXIF metadata. Participants must use an EXIF viewer to inspect each image and uncover the clue.

When decoded, each clue reveals a word or phrase. Combined together in the correct order, they form the full flag.

The order is not given directly—instead, it’s determined by the colors associated with each image, following the order of the rainbow spectrum (ROYGBIV). Each image includes a subtle visual hint to its corresponding color to aid in this sequencing.

Solution (to be put in flag format): encrypted transmissions are silently scattered across the colored frequencies of visible light

Description to be displayed for participants:
Something’s interfering with the spectrum. Fragments of a hidden message are scattered across a series of distorted signals. Can you intercept the clues buried in the noise? Tools won't help unless you look beneath the surface. Piece it together—the order matters. Note: (The gaps between signals matter — don't forget to separate what you find.)
