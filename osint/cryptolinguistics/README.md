# Cryptolinguistics

This is from a book. The flag is:

- The first proper noun in the book's title
- Language of book text
- The earliest year it was likely written in
- The country it was likely written in
- Its current location (one word)
- The page number of the large drawing on the right
- The page number of the ram drawing
- The page number of the scales drawing
- The page number of the fish drawing
- The page number of the first inscription not in the text's primary language that was written by its author (not some later owner)
- The page number of the text in the top left (hint: in the second half of the book)
- First known owner's first name

Page numbers separated by underscores. Everything is TitleCased unless it's standard notation.
