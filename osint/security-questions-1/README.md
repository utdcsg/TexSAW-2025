## Description

I’m worried about the security of my personal data and whether people can hack me! Can you find out my full name? 

P.S. You may ask other challenge creators or TEXSAW admins in the discord about me!

## Possible Hints? (only if like no ones solves it)


## Solution
The user should find hotcake’s discord which has my first name and ask anyone online about me there. I will ask other challenge creators to only say that they know I go to UTD and have done research, and I made the dean’s list at some point. From there they should be able to scrape either the dean’s list or Dr. Kim’s lab to find my full name. 

I will accept either
